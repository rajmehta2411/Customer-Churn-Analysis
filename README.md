# Customer-Churn-Analysis

# Project Title

The telecom industry is highly competitive, and customers have a wide selection of options to choose from. Companies rely heavily on customer retention to ensure continued growth and success. However, losing customers, also known as churn, is inevitable in any industry. As a data analyst, my job is to provide an in-depth analysis of Maven Telecomâ€™s churn dataset.
